# focus-blur
This example, as the text input gains and loses focus, feedback is shown to the user in the div element under the text input. The feedback is given using two functions. tipUsername() is triggered when the text input gains focus. It changes the class attribute of the element containing the message, and updates the contents of the element. checkUsername() is triggered when the text input loses focus. It adds a message and changes the class if the username is less than 5 characters; otherwise, it clears the message.
